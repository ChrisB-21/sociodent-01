# Appointment Confirmation Testing

This document explains how to test the appointment confirmation functionality in the admin portal.

## Manual Testing

1. Log in to the admin portal
2. Navigate to the Appointments section
3. Find a pending appointment
4. Click the "Reassign" button to open the reassignment modal
5. Select a doctor from the dropdown list
6. Click "Reassign Doctor" to confirm the assignment
7. Verify that the appointment status changes to "confirmed" and the doctor is assigned

## Automated Testing

We have created an automated test script to verify that the appointment confirmation functionality works properly.

To run the test:

```bash
npm run test:appointment
```

This script performs two tests:
1. Updates the status of a pending appointment to "confirmed"
2. Assigns a doctor to a pending appointment

## Common Issues

If you encounter issues with appointment confirmation:

1. **Permission Denied Errors**:
   - Check the Firebase database rules
   - Ensure the user has admin privileges
   - Verify the admin is properly authenticated

2. **Doctor Assignment Failures**:
   - Ensure there are approved doctors in the system
   - Check the database structure to ensure doctors have the correct properties
   - Verify the notification system is working properly

3. **UI Error Messages**:
   - The UI now displays detailed error messages
   - Check the browser console for additional error details
   - The error messages in the modal will help identify the specific issue
